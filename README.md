# MySQL Practice Exercises

A simple Node.js project that connects to a MySQL database to store iPhone product information.  
Includes an HTML form (`index.html`) to submit product data, which is saved into multiple MySQL tables via `app.js`.

## Files Included
- `app.js` – Server and database logic  
- `index.html` – Form to add products  
- `.gitignore` – Excludes `node_modules`  
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json` – Project dependencies  

## How to Run
1. Start your MySQL server (MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP).  
2. Run the server: `node app.js`  
3. Visit `/install` to create tables.  
4. Open `index.html` to submit products into the database.
